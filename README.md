# Hi, I'm Handi üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a data science enthusiast and a machine learning practitioner with a passion for solving real-world problems through data. I'm currently diving deep into various fields of data science and exploring innovative solutions for businesses.

## üöÄ About Me
I'm a data scientist focused on solving complex challenges using machine learning and artificial intelligence. I am currently working on building end-to-end machine learning pipelines and exploring the application of AI to creative domains. I have experience with a range of machine learning techniques including deep learning, NLP, and computer vision. Currently, I‚Äôm focused on applying these techniques to automate tasks in manga, like detecting dialogue bubbles and translating manga pages from Japanese to English.

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on **building an end-to-end ML pipeline for auto-translating manga pages from Japanese to English** and **YOLO-based manga bubble detection**.
- üå± I‚Äôm learning more about **Generative AI**, **Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)**, and **cloud-based ML pipelines**.
- üí¨ Ask me about **TensorFlow**, **YOLO**, **Machine Translation**, **Scikit-learn**, **Apache Airflow**, **Kibana**, and **Streamlit**.
