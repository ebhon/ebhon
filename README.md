# Hi, I'm Handi 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a data science enthusiast and a machine learning practitioner with a passion for solving real-world problems through data. I'm currently diving deep into various fields of data science and exploring innovative solutions for businesses. 

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a data scientist working on projects ranging from predictive modeling to natural language processing (NLP). Currently, I’m focusing on customer churn prediction, EV charging patterns, and leveraging the power of Generative AI. I also work on deploying machine learning models to the cloud and creating real-time dashboards using Kibana and Elasticsearch.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **PowerCo's customer churn analysis project** at BCG.
- 🌱 I’m learning about **Generative AI**, **NLP**, **Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)**, and **Cloud Computing**.
- 💬 Ask me about **TensorFlow**, **Scikit-learn**, **Apache Airflow**, **Kibana**, and **Streamlit**.
